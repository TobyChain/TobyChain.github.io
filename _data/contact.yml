  url: "https://scholar.google.com/"  # Initial placeholder as user said "currently none", but requested to change "feed link... to google scholar main page (currently none)". 
                                      # Wait, user said "google scholar homepage (currently none)". Does he mean he has none so link to generic homepage, or he wants a placeholder? 
                                      # "google scholar main page (currently none)" implies his personal one is missing, so maybe just link to scholar.google.com or leave it blank?
                                      # "separately changed to... google scholar homepage (currently none)" -> I will link to "https://scholar.google.com/" for now or comment it out? 
                                      # User said "change to... google scholar homepage". I'll assume generic homepage or a placeholder.
                                      # Re-reading: "(currently none)" might refer to the fact he doesn't have one yet, but wants the link there? 
                                      # "Separately changed to... google scholar homepage (currently none)". 
                                      # Actually, "main page" usually implies the root site. Let's stick to https://scholar.google.com/ or a placeholder. 
                                      # Wait, looking at the request: "google scholar main page (currently none)" -> "google scholar main page (currently none)" -> maybe he means "Google Scholar Profile" but since he has none, link to main page?
                                      # I'll just use https://scholar.google.com/ for now as it's safe.
